# WebApplication8NETFX47

ASP.Net Core 1.1 on .NET Framework 4.7 solution generated with Visual Studio 2017 Community.

Requires file-based Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0 SP1 backend, which you need to download from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30709>.

Because of this dependency, needs full .NET runtime (see <https://github.com/ErikEJ/EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact>.)
